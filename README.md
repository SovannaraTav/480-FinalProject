### Project Description:
To further explore the theme of communication and collaboration between people, our group focused on the human-computer interaction (HCI) technique of voice input. Users within this space work in an environment emphasizing communication and collaboration as well as using productivity and collaboration software tools to complete their tasks. This requires them to manually click, select, type, and perform many other actions which can be tedious especially when navigating and interacting with different productivity and collaboration software tools that serve different purposes. Users are required to remember the layout of the user interface for each different productivity and collaboration software tool in order to understand where each component is located, what each component does, and the sequence of steps to perform a specific action. With that being the case, the HCI technique of voice input would provide users with an intuitive, hands-free experience with minimal disruption when interacting and navigating, relieving them from the need to burden their memory, and allowing them to focus more on completing their tasks.

Thus, to facilitate the HCI technique of voice input, we incorporated it with smart glasses that enabled the users to provide hands-free voice commands to 1) conduct a live video meeting with other people, 2) send and view messages to other people, 3) view and manage their calendar schedule, and 4) change their settings to their preferences. A digital voice assistant of the user's choosing such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant would reply to the userâ€™s voice commands, perform the necessary navigation and interaction, and display relevant information through a digital heads-up display using augmented reality elements. The smart glasses would incorporate the use of external cameras, built-in microphones and speakers, and sensors. To put our design into practice, we created a Figma prototype to demonstrate and showcase the user interface of our smart glasses and the user experience when interacting and navigating through the listed functionalities above.
